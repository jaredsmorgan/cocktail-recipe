# Project #2: Elixir: Drink Recipes Version 1.0

## Definition

**Elixir**

An elixir is a clear, sweet-flavored liquid used for medical purposes, to be taken orally and intended to cure one's illness.When used as a pharmaceutical preparation, an elixir contains at least one active ingredient designed to be taken orally.(_source: Wikipedia_)

**Recipes**

A recipe is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make something, especially a dish of prepared food.

The term recipe is also used in medicine or in information technology (_e.g., user acceptance_). A doctor will usually begin a prescription with recipe, Latin for take, usually abbreviated as Rx or the equivalent symbol (â„ž).(_source: Wikipedia_)

## Application Preview

## Target Audience

Anyone legally old enough to drink legally in their country of residence. Amateur Mixologist and bartenders alike. Drink enthusiast and lovers of relaxation and leisure.

## Why I chose this Application

I thought it was an interesting and original way yo display skills using the tools given and the assigned time. I was particularly inspired by the **Afiniti** version of **Rock Paper Scissors**. In this version the user can play against an IA player who learns from their every move.

I made this game as part of my second project assignment for **General Assembly** coding bootcamp.

Here are other reasons to play **Rock paper Scissors** from the WRPSA (_The World Rock Paper Scissors Association_)

-   No Age Requirement to Play
-   No need for training to compete at a professional level
-   No physical barriers to Play
-   No one is naturally better at the sport then anyone else
-   There is no setup required to start the game
-   No cleanup after the game is over
-   Allows for quick decision making
-   There is no age or gender bias

## History

Purposeful production of alcoholic drinks is common and often reflects cultural and religious peculiarities as much as geographical and sociological conditions.

Discovery of late Stone Age jugs suggest that intentionally fermented beverages existed at least as early as the Neolithic period (_c. 10000 BC_).(_source: Wikipedia_)

## The Application

**Elixir: Drink Recipes**

is a zero sum game that is usually played by two people using their hands and no tools. The idea is to make shapes with an outstretched hand where each shape will have a certain degree of power and will lead to an outcome.(_source: The World Rock Paper Scissors Association_)

## Instructions

Chose one of three options to play against the computer.
Once you have chosen, the computer would also make a choice.
A win, a lose or a draw message would be posted for each party.
There are three chances to win, lose and draw.

## Hardware Platform

This game is _web-based_ and can be played on desktop and laptop computers. _Mobile_ option for phones and tablets need optimization.

## The Making of the Game

I have encounter several obstacles while planing and making this game.
Functions under Javascript and behavior under CSS were the most challenging among the many hurtles that I encounter.

## The API

## Handmade Wireframes

## Code Sample

```javascript
function computerPlay() {
    computerChoice = choices[Math.floor(Math.random() * choices.length)];
    calculateResults();
}
```

This code help me simulate the choices another player would make.(\_source: `GeeksforGeeks.com`)
