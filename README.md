# Project #2: Elixir: Drink Recipes Version 1.0

## Definition

**Elixir** is a clear, sweet-flavored liquid used for medical purposes, to be taken orally and intended to cure one's illness.When used as a pharmaceutical preparation, an elixir contains at least one active ingredient designed to be taken orally.(_source: Wikipedia_)

**Recipes** are sets of instructions that describes how to prepare or make something, especially a dish of prepared food.
The term recipe is also used in medicine or in information technology (_e.g., user acceptance_). A doctor will usually begin a prescription with recipe, Latin for take, usually abbreviated as Rx or the equivalent symbol (â„ž).(_source: Wikipedia_)

**Mixology** is another term for a bartender or bar chef. However, mixology is generally accepted as a refined and in-depth study of the art and craft of mixing drinks. Think of it as the study of the chemistry of drinks, and the mixologist as the professional who studies and practices that.(_source: The Spruce Eats_)

## Application Preview

## Target Audience

Anyone legally old enough to drink legally in their country of residence. Amateur Mixologist and bartenders alike. Drink enthusiast and lovers of relaxation and leisure.

## Why I chose this Application

Drinking is a social, recreational and relaxing activity. Most humans on this planet have a relationship with alcohol. I decided to make this application as a tribute to the ritual of alcohol, the different types there are and how we mix it into incredible combinations all around the world. One could say alcohol unites us as a specie. You'll find this application educational, fun and exciting. So have a drink on me!

I made this game as part of my second project assignment for **General Assembly** coding bootcamp.

## History

Purposeful production of alcoholic drinks is common and often reflects cultural and religious peculiarities as much as geographical and sociological conditions. Discovery of late Stone Age jugs suggest that intentionally fermented beverages existed at least as early as the Neolithic period (_c. 10000 BC_).(_source: Wikipedia_)

## The Application

**Elixir: Drink Recipes** is a catalog of mixed drinks from all over the world. The API used in this app is populated by all users that are part of this open project.

## Instructions

Upon entry, you are presented with featured drink choices. You can pick one of them or use the search bar to find the drink of your choice based on a few criteria.
Once you have chosen your drink, you are presented with ingredients and instructions in how to prepare the given drink.

## Hardware Platform

This game is _web-based_ application for use on a desktop and laptop computers. _Mobile_ option for phones and tablets needs optimization.

## The Making of the Application

I have encounter several obstacles while planing and making this app.
Functions under JSX and behavior under CSS were the most challenging among the many hurtles that I encounter.

## The API

Is an open, crowd-sourced database of drinks and cocktails from around the world.
They also offer a free JSON API for anyone wanting to use it.

## Code Sample

```javascript
function computerPlay() {
    computerChoice = choices[Math.floor(Math.random() * choices.length)];
    calculateResults();
}
```

This code help me simulate the choices another player would make.(\_source: `help here`)
